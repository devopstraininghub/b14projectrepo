Benefits of Healthcare Domain Knowledge for QA Engineers

Improved Test Design and Execution: QA engineers with domain expertise are better equipped to create and carry out test scenarios that more closely mimic actual user interactions and use (Hossain, 2020). They can pinpoint crucial areas for testing and allocate their resources appropriately by being aware of the clinical processes and data flow that occur within the healthcare system.

More Defect Detection: QA engineers are more equipped to recognize and report issues pertaining to functionality, usability, and standard compliance when they possess a greater comprehension of healthcare language and laws (Reddy, 2021). By doing this, the possibility of software faults affecting patient care and safety may be greatly decreased.

Good Communication and Cooperation: Developers, medical professionals, and other stakeholders may communicate and work together more effectively when there is domain expertise (Hossain, 2020). Based on their comprehension of the domain context, QA engineers are able to articulate their results, talk about possible hazards, and provide solutions.

QA engineers may achieve more efficiency and shorter testing times by streamlining the testing process and concentrating on the most important features of the product, as well as by comprehending the intended behavior (Guru99, 2023).

Enhanced Regulatory Compliance: To guarantee that healthcare software complies with legal requirements and protects patient data, a detailed grasp of industry laws and standards, such as HIPAA, DICOM, and HL7, is essential (Reddy, 2021).
