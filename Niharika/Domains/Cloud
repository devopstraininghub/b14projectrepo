Cloud computing enables people to access software applications, data storage and other services over the internet instead of through traditional physical servers in a back office.

The cloud computing model enables users of internet-based computing services to be charged for what they consume on a pay-per-use basis. This is often referred to as a consumption-based pricing model and is a departure from more traditional subscription-based pricing models.

There are three main types of cloud services:

Software as a service. SaaS refers to on-demand hosted services that provide access to business applications.
Platform as a service. PaaS refers to web-based services and deployment of applications in the cloud.
Infrastructure as a service. IaaS refers to virtualized computing resources over the internet and often offer storage.
Cloud services are attractive to many businesses because they don't need to buy and maintain their own physical technology products, software, storage and infrastructure.

The cloud computing world is currently dominated by a handful of large, public cloud service providers (CSPs) and their products. These include AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure. These vendors can deliver the same service to hundreds of thousands -- or even millions -- of customers across different industries at an attractive price point.
